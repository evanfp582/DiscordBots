This Program was created in a mock hackathon with River and I in January of 2021.

We learned the discord bot system and create a bot that reads messages that are sent in a channel

We were able to successfully make the bot interact to certain messages and talk to the pokemon API.
The users were able to create a party of poekmon and have them battle eachother
